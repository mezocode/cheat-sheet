## Key Takeaways

- **Startup Time & Memory Footprint**: Both Micronaut and Quarkus boast a fast startup time and a low memory footprint, making them ideal for microservices and serverless environments. Spring Boot is making progress with Spring Native but is traditionally slower and more resource-intensive.

- **IoC/DI**: Micronaut and Quarkus use AOT compilation for dependency injection, leading to faster startup times and less runtime overhead. Spring Boot's runtime DI offers flexibility but can affect performance.

- **Reactive Programming**: All frameworks offer reactive programming options; however, Micronaut and Quarkus are designed with this paradigm as a core focus.

- **AOT Compilation**: While all support AOT compilation, Micronaut and Quarkus provide a more integrated experience with GraalVM.

- **Cloud Native**: Micronaut and Quarkus are specifically tailored for cloud-native deployments, with Quarkus being optimized for Kubernetes and serverless environments. Spring Boot has adapted through Spring Cloud for cloud support.

- **Hot Reloading**: Quarkus differentiates itself with live coding and continuous testing features, while Micronaut and Spring Boot provide standard hot reloading capabilities.

- **Microservice Patterns**: Micronaut and Quarkus come with built-in support for microservice patterns, whereas Spring Boot relies on Spring Cloud for these functionalities.

- **Community/Support**: Spring Boot benefits from the extensive Spring ecosystem community. Micronaut and Quarkus have smaller but actively growing communities and support networks.

- **Learning Curve**: The Spring ecosystem's complexity can make Spring Boot's learning curve steeper compared to Micronaut and Quarkus, which may be more straightforward for new projects.

Remember, the choice of framework should be based on specific project needs, team expertise, and compatibility with existing systems.
